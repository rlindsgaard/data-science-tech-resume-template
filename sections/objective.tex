% Objective Statement
%====================

I am a hobby programmer turned entrepeneur turned educated software engineer. Throughout my 16 years in the industry I have learned my passion not only revolves around code, but also the processes and organization making the software products.
\newline\newline
I continuosly work hard on improving my techniques and knowledge within my field, and I work best alongside people with the same drive and passion as me.
\newline\newline
I have "full stack" expertise and know process management, but my preference is working with DevEx and the platform working on making other people deliver better code faster. I prefer other developers being my users.
I am above all else a toolsmith.
\newline\newline
I cherish and practice clean, declarative and maintainable code and design. I am a pragmatist, and through experience I have learned that my own standards should not necessarily be imposed on everyone, that depends on the teams and the people. Instead I try to be the change I'd like to see in others.
\newline\newline
I work well autonomously but I believe my best work is done in teams with close collaboration -- pair programming is ideally a daily activity for me. I prefer to spar and weigh ideas with peers before putting then into action. The people I have the highest respect for and learned the most from in my career are the ones I have also disagreed and debated with the most.
I need people around me whom I can respect for their knowledge and disagree with on a technical level. This is what makes us find the best possible solutions and learn -- together.
\newline\newline
My greatest strength is my natural cognitive capacity and ability to quickly detect and understand all the cogwheels in the processes, organization and problem domain. This ability together with experience it has enabled me to detect problems and misconseptions early in the design phase. It is also my achilles heel as I do not like broken windows, and I want to fix them.
\newline\newline
As a result I find constant, open and honest communication of utmost importance between my peers as well as my superiors. 
\newline\newline
To thrive I need to believe I create value, and feel that I am working effectively, to me that requires a clear vision and direction set out by the leadership team without too many shifting priorities as well as the tools and resources to do my job well.
