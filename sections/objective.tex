% Objective Statement
%====================

I am a hobby programmer turned professional software engineer. Throughout the years I have learned my passion, not only revolves around code, but also the processes and organization making up software products.
\newline\newline
Engineering is a craft for me and I continually work on improving my professional capabilities within the field.
\newline\newline
The software I get the most satisfaction from writing is platform code and re-usable components. I get personal satisfaction when fellow developers use components I decide and my abstractions fit.
\newline\newline
I value and practice clean, declarative and maintainable code. I furthermore take great pride in how I test and document my work. I strive for excellence and mastery and therefore I continually expirement with new ideas and learn from the result welcoming any chance I get passing on that knowledge.
\newline\newline
I work well autonomously but I believe my best work is done in teams with close collaboration -- pair programming is ideally a daily activity for me.I prefer to spar and weigh ideas with peers. The people I have the highest respect for and learned the most from in my career are the ones I have also disagreed and debated with the most.
\newline\newline
My greatest strength is my natural cognitive capacity to see and understand all the cogwheels making up the processes, organization and problem domain. It is also my achilles heel as I do not like broken windows.
\newline\newline
As a result I find communication and alignment valuable; between peers in terms of task-/project-management,  and buy-in to the process from management wanting clear visions, goals, and prioritization from the organization in order to create value.
